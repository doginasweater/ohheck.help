A site for surveys for my two favourite youtubers, [aki and chrissu](https://youtube.com/c/OhHeck). If you have any issues, please log them in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/myopicmage/ohheck.help/issues). Thanks for your support!

## Build instructions:

1) install [.net core 2.0 preview 1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview)
2) clone the repository
3) `cd` into folder
4) `dotnet restore`
5) `npm install`
6) `dotnet run`

**Please note** that this is running off of preview software, and will be undergoing many changes as they release new versions of .net core. This started out as a passion project but has turned into something a little more serious.
