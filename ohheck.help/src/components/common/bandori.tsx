                        Demonika’s comment: Currently without having my tablet, it would have taken too much time to
                        individually draw each girl onto the model of their outfit, so I sadly used the model for Karen
                        3 times over with the respective colour combinations for each girl.

                    Once belonging to the production company 629 Pro, we split our ties with the company to form our own
                    band, called Humanity. If our third member is ill, we prefer to use a spin on our old unit name,
                    Goddess Decorium.

                    Profile: An optimistic girl who first joined up with 629 in the hopes of finding more punk and rock
                    idols. After finding two and having a falling out with the production company, Karen moved on with
                    them to make their own band and perform at all the various gigs she would attend herself. She's
                    spunky, quick witted, though often very ambitious, luckily her cousin Aria is there to remind her of
                    the more realistic goals. Every morning she'll go out for a run around the edge of the nearby
                    fields, often taking the time to think of inspiration for their next song. She is the groups main
                    singer and guitarist, as well as their technician. She enjoys nothing more when performing than to
                    see her crowd hyped and having a good time. She one day hopes that they will gain enough recognition
                    to make it into the biggest gig of their country, 3 Nights Rock On. Until that day, she vows to
                    carry on making rock music that everyone can enjoy, and to keep on enjoying her life.

                    Aria once loved, what it was like to be with them, enveloped by it.<br />

                    Food: Curry<br />
                    Hobbies: Drawing, costume design, swimming<br />
                    Skills: Sewing, leatherworking, hair stylist, lyric writing<br />
                    Starlight Stage Attribute: Passion, Dance<br />
                    Charm Point: Cheeky smile<br />
                    Profile: Aria's older cousin who was in 629 long before Karen was. Following the falling out
                    incident, Aria agreed in making a new group that would strive to not be bogged down by the bigger
                    companies, to be free. Aria often dreams of her lover that she lost a year after they were going to
                    get married, her lover always enjoyed her music. In his memory, she promised to carry on singing and
                    performing until her she couldn't any more. She's extremely laid back and often has to be told off
                    by Karen for slacking when work needed to be done for upcoming gigs. She often begins to wonder
                    about life and why certain things are the way there are, using her wonder as inspiration for some of
                    the lyrics that go into their music. Whilst her laid back attitude may make her seem like she
                    doesn't care some time, deep down Aria cares the most about making their rock band a success, to
                    push themselves to the limits and create the best music they can.

                    Hobbies: Vocal training, score composing, nature walks<br />
                    Skills: Performance with paino, bass guitar and drums, vocal training<br />
                    Starlight Stage Attribute: Cute, Visual<br />
                    Charm Point: Overt shyness<br />
                    Profile: Lucida from birth has always been physically weaker than she'd like to be. She can
                    sometimes barely make it through a round of performances before passing out from exhaustion. She
                    joined 629 in the hopes of improving her form. Whilst it did help, she asked if Karen and Aria would
                    allow her to join them in their efforts on a new rock band. Whilst she was a more light hearted
                    musician, she wanted to delve into that genre for a while, and offers her expertise in vocals and
                    instruments as a deal. One day Lucida hopes she might be able to overcome her struggles with her
                    body and perform to her hearts content, not bound by her illness. Often she has to sit out of
                    performances to go to the hospital for check ups. Like Karen, Lucida just wishes that the music they
                    make makes others happy, and that they enjoy the performances they put on. She's a bit shy due to
                    her earlier years in life being rather hospital confined, and she's also rather cautious of any
                    risks that Karen tries to take with their band. However, she tries her best to input her ideas and
                    compose their music.

                    Profile: Mirai always dreamed of performing on stage. She hoped to be famous and make everyone smile
                    one day. Unfortunately she was harassed constantly for being a Trans girl. She swore that from then
                    on, she’d keep it a secret. Slowly she withdrew from social aspects of life and focused more on
                    reading dictionaries. She hoped to learn more words to help better explain how she feels and to help
                    others understand. One day while out, she saw a poster for the Production Company, “CAN)(WE” looking
                    for recruits. She decided to step out of her comfort zone and pursue her dreams. Now with support
                    from fan, family, and friends, she is comfortable with who she is and plans on showing it! “Hey
                    everyone! I finally know who I am, and I’m excited for you all to hear...MY: TRUTH!”

                    rap. She is currently apart of TAKEON, an idol company that splits the idols into specific subunits.

                    the animals so she has what she would consider, training. Echo absolutely adores animals, especially
                    cats! Her cat named Shi-Chan has gone with her on the trip. The animals love her back also and often
                    help her with problems that she has.You may think she is just a simple girl who can eat a lot, but
                    you got another thing coming!

                    A talent agency, small but very dedicated to the craft of training and promoting their idols. They
                    are very protective of their idols´s private identities, both for the sake of their Stage Personas
                    and for their own safety. Most of what's known from the idols comes from what they decide to share
                    on their personal social media, but most idols who join this agency do so for the sake of keeping a
                    low profile anyway.

                    Alex (Actual name kept secret) is a frustrated artist who used to play the piano and had even
                    dabbled in composing, but had a falling out with all things artistic until he decided to become an
                    idol as a way of aproaching music from a new perspective. Fairly shy and pretty much always worried
                    about something, which makes handling idol activites quite overwhelming from time to time, as well
                    as a bit of an unfashionable slob off stage, which makes him nearly irrecognizeable by most fans
                    (Something 13Pro apreciates in an odd way), but the moment he puts on an outfit and gets on stage,
                    he completely lets out and becomes the ultimate drama queen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite all this, he can be surprisingly mature and down to earth when it comes to dealing with
                    other people´s problems and gains the trust of his fellow idols pretty quickly, bringing some ease
                    into their stressful lifes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A HUGE eater, knows how to cook some decent meals. Extremely weak to the whims of the weather, his
                    body has absolutely no sense of how to regulate temperatures. Is known to die after pretty much
                    every single big performance due to overheating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has a bit of an accent, which brings a curious flavor to his singing, but he usually tries to use
                    it to his advantage to make his performances more unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Has broken down emotionally in the middle couple of live performances, but the fans are always
                    willing to cheer for him, as are other idols at 13Pro. His dream is that he can someday compose ones
                    of his own image songs and actually perform it live for his public. He has found meaning in the
                    emotional reactions of the public and cherishes them dearly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently a solo performer who only occasionally stars in a few of 13Pro´s units and group songs as
                    a guest. Most likely to trip in the middle of a live, never fall but break props or his own glasses
                    in the process
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are rumours that a man, very similar to him, has been spotted giving some very heartfelt and
                    latino flavored performances in completely unrelated venues but no one can be too sure. The true
                    advantage of working for Himitsu Pro

                    Cho is a girl who gives the appearance of someone serious, cool and smart, her classmates think that
                    she is perfect but lonely since she does not have friends, people do not dare to talk to her because
                    according to the rumors she is someone mysterious and fearful, but there is one thing that makes her
                    stand out, besides her own talents, is that she is the daughter of Sousuke Sayaka, a great singer
                    known worldwide !!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cho lives alone with her mother, the only person who knows as a true personality, her mother sees
                    her daughter as energetic, kind, determined and talented girl!.She knows that her daughter does not
                    have many friends which worries her a little, but she knows that Cho is strong and can handle it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cho always dreamed of being an artist, an Idol, someone as talented as her father, but she is afraid
                    that people do not like what she really is.She has been sending a request to some companies to
                    listen to one of her songs, but so far none has accepted her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But one day something almost magical happens in the life of Cho! The YAKASTARS company where her
                    father works has sent a letter because they want to hear her voice!!! This can be a great
                    opportunity.

                    Profile: Yuki, meaning snow in Japanese, was named due to her baby blue eyes. She is a blunt yet
                    charming girl, and she is more on the traditional side of most. Lecturing is quite common when it
                    comes to her, as she seems to be quite picky, but she always ends up getting scorned by an idol
                    older than her due to her blunt attitude. Besides her brash personality is a calm woman inside. She
                    has a soft spot for animals and loves to care for any animals, even if her favourite food is a type
                    of fish. She owns a cat named Snowflake whom she loves dearly, though the cat doesn't like to pay
                    much mind. She also likes to care for the children in her production group, albeit she seems to
                    treat them like pets, not people. Her hair is almost always in a bun, and is dyed a dark red,
                    although her natural hair colour seems to be a deep brown. She believed red fit her better, so she
                    decided to do it. Most of the time she is dressed basically, and most commonly is wearing a denim
                    button-up sleeve-less shirt and a long skirt and flats. She is taught a lot of the time on what to
                    wear by other idols due to the fact she doesn't seem to have much common fashion sense or else she
                    would be walking in kimonos. Her skin is a slightly shaded brown, making a lot of light colours look
                    quite nice on her, but she much prefers darker colours. [Notes: Sorry this was long! I go to town
                    with writing.]

                    Profile: Hana is the resident princely-type chuuni idol of 416 (Shiro) Pro—at least, on a surface
                    level. Charismatic and funny with an overflowing androgynous charm, she serves as a role model to
                    the younger idols. However, despite having an overwhelming confidence on stage and around other
                    idols, Hana is nothing more than a musical-theatre-obsessed, non-binary wallflower who became an
                    idol after the producer attended one of her shows. She refused immediately at first, thinking she
                    would have to wear dresses and look girly on stage, but eventually accepted once the producer told
                    her she could dress as androgynously as she wanted. She can tend to be a bit lazy, but realizes that
                    the work pays off once she gets to see everyone’s smiles.

                    Profile: Very charming at first glance. Seems very mature on the outside, but actually quite
                    emotionally unstable. She gets flustered very easily, and finds it very hard to take a compliment.
                    She can get very absorbed in anything she enjoys, so absorbed that everything else around her is a
                    blur. This can be a good thing within school idols, getting absorbed in the rush of the performance
                    and becoming an idol with a lot of personality, showing her true self for what she is. Ari's a very
                    level-headed individual who can solve a conflict easily, but has no sense of organisation. She's not
                    very good at managing things, and tends to let important things slip by. She'd rather let someone
                    else take the lead, and just follow the instructions.

                    Profile: after being an orphan for the first 16 years of his life, Tomo got taken in by the head of
                    the White Dragon yakuza clan. Having fought his way to the top, he got betrayed by one of his
                    brothers who set him up to fail a very important mission. Because of the clans code he would've been
                    killed then and there, but due to the heads respect for him, the worst punishment Tomo received was
                    getting banished from the city. Since that day Tomo has been striving to preserve justice, trying to
                    help out people wherever he can. The reason he became an idol is to inspire others to seek their own
                    sense of justice and live an honest life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to his nature, Tomo has no problems taking care of perverts creeping on unwilling females,
                    thiefs or drunks picking fights with defenseless people.

                    friends soon became known as Quiet⭐Power and have been known for their pop rock songs. Kiyoshi has
                    recently been picking up popularity for being the first sucessful genderfluid idol. They're very
                    laid back and can be considered the &quot;voice of reasoning&quot; in the group. There are
                    occasionally dissagreements within the group, and Kiyoshi seems to always be the one to put an end
                    to them. Kiyoshi seems to be a person with very little emotions, but the moment they step onto a
                    stage, they become a completely different person. They have said once in an interview, &quot;It
                    doesn't matter how I could be feeling prior to the event, what matters is that I help put on the
                    best show for our fans.
